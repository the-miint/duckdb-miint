# Miint

This repository is based on https://github.com/duckdb/extension-template, check it out if you want to build and ship your own DuckDB extension.

---

This extension, Miint, allow you to ... <extension_goal>.


## Building
### Managing dependencies
DuckDB extensions uses VCPKG for dependency management. Enabling VCPKG is very simple: follow the [installation instructions](https://vcpkg.io/en/getting-started) or just run the following:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg.git
./vcpkg/bootstrap-vcpkg.sh
export VCPKG_TOOLCHAIN_PATH=`pwd`/vcpkg/scripts/buildsystems/vcpkg.cmake
```
Note: VCPKG is only required for extensions that want to rely on it for dependency management. If you want to develop an extension without dependencies, or want to do your own dependency management, just skip this step. Note that the example extension uses VCPKG to build with a dependency for instructive purposes, so when skipping this step the build may not work without removing the dependency.

### Build steps
Now to build the extension, run:
```sh
make
```
The main binaries that will be built are:
```sh
./build/release/duckdb
./build/release/test/unittest
./build/release/extension/miint/miint.duckdb_extension
```
- `duckdb` is the binary for the duckdb shell with the extension code automatically loaded.
- `unittest` is the test runner of duckdb. Again, the extension is already linked into the binary.
- `miint.duckdb_extension` is the loadable binary as it would be distributed.

## Running the extension
To run the extension code, simply start the shell with `./build/release/duckdb`.

## Functions

### `read_alignments(filename, [reference_lengths='table_name'], [include_filepath=false])`
Read SAM/BAM alignment files.

**Note:** `read_sam` is still supported as a backward-compatible alias.

**Parameters:**
- `filename` (VARCHAR or VARCHAR[]): Path to SAM/BAM file(s)
- `reference_lengths` (VARCHAR, optional): Table name containing reference sequences for headerless SAM files. Table must have at least 2 columns: first column = reference name (VARCHAR), second column = reference length (INTEGER/BIGINT). Column names don't matter.
- `include_filepath` (BOOLEAN, optional, default false): Add filepath column to output

**Output schema includes:**
- `position` (BIGINT): 1-based start position
- `stop_position` (BIGINT): 1-based stop position (computed from CIGAR using `bam_endpos`)
- `cigar` (VARCHAR): CIGAR string
- Plus other standard SAM fields and optional tags

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Read SAM file with header
SELECT * FROM read_alignments('alignments.sam');

-- Read BAM file
SELECT * FROM read_alignments('alignments.bam');

-- Read headerless SAM file (requires reference table)
CREATE TABLE my_refs AS
  SELECT 'chr1' AS name, 248956422 AS length
  UNION ALL SELECT 'chr2', 242193529;
SELECT * FROM read_alignments('headerless.sam', reference_lengths='my_refs');

-- Read multiple files with filepath tracking
SELECT * FROM read_alignments(['file1.sam', 'file2.bam'], include_filepath=true);

-- Backward compatible: read_sam still works
SELECT * FROM read_sam('alignments.sam');
```

### `read_fastx(filename)`
Read FASTA/FASTQ sequence files.

### SAM Flag Functions

Test individual SAM flag bits. Each function takes a `USMALLINT` (the flags column from `read_sam`) and returns a `BOOLEAN`.

**Primary names:**
- `alignment_is_paired(flags)` - Read is paired (0x1)
- `alignment_is_proper_pair(flags)` - Read is properly paired (0x2)
- `alignment_is_unmapped(flags)` - Read is unmapped (0x4)
- `alignment_is_mate_unmapped(flags)` - Mate is unmapped (0x8)
- `alignment_is_reverse(flags)` - Read is reverse strand (0x10)
- `alignment_is_mate_reverse(flags)` - Mate is reverse strand (0x20)
- `alignment_is_read1(flags)` - Read is first in pair (0x40)
- `alignment_is_read2(flags)` - Read is second in pair (0x80)
- `alignment_is_secondary(flags)` - Secondary alignment (0x100)
- `alignment_is_primary(flags)` - NOT alignment_is_secondary
- `alignment_is_qc_failed(flags)` - QC failure (0x200)
- `alignment_is_duplicate(flags)` - PCR/optical duplicate (0x400)
- `alignment_is_supplementary(flags)` - Supplementary alignment (0x800)

**HTSlib-compatible aliases:**
`is_paired`, `is_proper_pair`, `is_unmapped`, `is_munmap`, `is_reverse`, `is_mreverse`, `is_read1`, `is_read2`, `is_secondary`, `is_qcfail`, `is_dup`, `is_supplementary`

**Example:**
```sql
SELECT read_id, flags
FROM read_alignments('alignments.sam')
WHERE alignment_is_paired(flags)
  AND NOT alignment_is_unmapped(flags);
```

### `alignment_seq_identity(cigar, nm, md, type)`

Calculate sequence identity between read and reference using three different methods. They are derived from Heng Li's [blog post](https://lh3.github.io/2018/11/25/on-the-definition-of-sequence-identity).

*IMPORTANT*: these calculations assume use of '='/'X' (e.g., `--xeq` with bowtie2, `-eqx` with minimap2, etc).

**Parameters:**
- `cigar` (VARCHAR): CIGAR string from alignment.
- `nm` (BIGINT): NM tag value (edit distance)
- `md` (VARCHAR): MD tag value (mismatch positions)
- `type` (VARCHAR, default='gap_compressed'): Identity calculation method

**Identity types:**

1. **`'gap_excluded'`**: Ignore gaps, only consider match/mismatch positions
   - Formula: `#matches / (#matches + #mismatches)`
   - Requires: CIGAR + MD tag
   - Use case: Genetic divergence between species

2. **`'blast'`**: Traditional BLAST-style identity
   - Formula: `#matches / alignment_columns`
   - Requires: CIGAR + NM tag
   - Use case: General similarity measurement
   - Note: Large indels significantly lower identity

3. **`'gap_compressed'`** (default): Count consecutive gaps as single events
   - Formula: `(m - n + g) / (m + o)` where m=M_columns, n=NM, g=gap_bases, o=gap_opens
   - Equivalent to: `1 - (n - g + o) / (m + o)` from the blog post
   - Requires: CIGAR + NM tag
   - Use case: Filtering alignments (recommended)
   - Note: More robust to structural variations

**Returns:** DOUBLE between 0.0 and 1.0, or NULL for unmapped reads or missing required tags

**Example:**
```sql
-- Calculate gap-compressed identity (default)
SELECT read_id, alignment_seq_identity(cigar, tag_nm, tag_md, 'gap_compressed') AS identity
FROM read_alignments('alignments.sam')
WHERE tag_nm IS NOT NULL;

-- Filter high-quality alignments
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM read_alignments('alignments.bam')
WHERE alignment_seq_identity(cigar, tag_nm, tag_md) > 0.95;

-- Compare different identity methods
SELECT read_id,
  alignment_seq_identity(cigar, tag_nm, tag_md, 'gap_excluded') AS gap_excl,
  alignment_seq_identity(cigar, tag_nm, tag_md, 'blast') AS blast,
  alignment_seq_identity(cigar, tag_nm, tag_md, 'gap_compressed') AS gap_comp
FROM read_alignments('alignments.sam')
WHERE tag_nm IS NOT NULL AND tag_md IS NOT NULL;
```

### `alignment_query_length(cigar, [include_hard_clips=true])`

Calculate the total query length from a CIGAR string. This is useful for understanding read lengths and query coverage.

**Parameters:**
- `cigar` (VARCHAR): CIGAR string from alignment
- `include_hard_clips` (BOOLEAN, default=true): Whether to include hard-clipped bases in the length

**Returns:** BIGINT - Total query length, or 0 for NULL/unmapped reads

**Behavior:**
- When `include_hard_clips=true`: Returns M + I + S + = + X + H (all query-consuming operations)
- When `include_hard_clips=false`: Returns M + I + S + = + X (matches HTSlib's `bam_cigar2qlen`)
- Soft clips (S) are always included (they're present in the sequence field)
- Hard clips (H) are only included when parameter is true
- Deletions (D) and reference skips (N) don't consume query, so they're never counted

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Get query length including hard clips (default)
SELECT read_id, alignment_query_length(cigar) AS query_len
FROM read_alignments('alignments.sam');

-- Get query length excluding hard clips (matches bam_cigar2qlen)
SELECT read_id, alignment_query_length(cigar, false) AS query_len
FROM read_alignments('alignments.sam');

-- Compare lengths with and without hard clips
SELECT read_id, cigar,
  alignment_query_length(cigar, true) AS len_with_hard,
  alignment_query_length(cigar, false) AS len_without_hard
FROM read_alignments('alignments.sam')
WHERE cigar LIKE '%H%';

-- Calculate average query length per reference
SELECT reference, AVG(alignment_query_length(cigar)) AS avg_query_len
FROM read_alignments('alignments.bam')
WHERE NOT alignment_is_unmapped(flags)
GROUP BY reference;
```

**Note:** When `include_hard_clips=false`, this function's output matches HTSlib's `bam_cigar2qlen` behavior, which counts M, I, S, =, and X operations.

### `alignment_query_coverage(cigar, [type='aligned'])`

Calculate the proportion of query bases covered by the reference alignment. This helps assess how much of a read actually aligns versus being clipped.

**Parameters:**
- `cigar` (VARCHAR): CIGAR string from alignment
- `type` (VARCHAR, default='aligned'): Coverage calculation method

**Coverage types:**

1. **`'aligned'`** (default): Bases that align to the reference
   - Formula: `(M + = + X) / (M + I + S + = + X + H)`
   - Only counts bases that match/mismatch the reference
   - Insertions and clips reduce coverage

2. **`'mapped'`**: Bases that are mapped (not clipped)
   - Formula: `(M + I + = + X) / (M + I + S + = + X + H)`
   - Counts insertions as "mapped" even though they don't align
   - Only clips reduce coverage

**Returns:** DOUBLE between 0.0 and 1.0, or NULL for NULL CIGAR

**Behavior:**
- Query length denominator always includes hard clips
- Returns 0.0 for reads with only clipping operations (no alignment)
- Deletions (D) and reference skips (N) don't affect coverage (they don't consume query)

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Get aligned coverage (default)
SELECT read_id, alignment_query_coverage(cigar) AS aligned_cov
FROM read_alignments('alignments.sam');

-- Get mapped coverage (includes insertions)
SELECT read_id, alignment_query_coverage(cigar, 'mapped') AS mapped_cov
FROM read_alignments('alignments.sam');

-- Compare aligned vs mapped coverage
SELECT read_id, cigar,
  alignment_query_coverage(cigar, 'aligned') AS aligned_cov,
  alignment_query_coverage(cigar, 'mapped') AS mapped_cov
FROM read_alignments('alignments.sam')
WHERE cigar LIKE '%I%';  -- Reads with insertions show the difference

-- Filter reads with high query coverage
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM read_alignments('alignments.bam')
WHERE alignment_query_coverage(cigar, 'aligned') > 0.9;

-- Find heavily clipped reads
SELECT read_id, cigar, alignment_query_coverage(cigar) AS coverage
FROM read_alignments('alignments.sam')
WHERE alignment_query_coverage(cigar) < 0.5
ORDER BY coverage;

-- Calculate average coverage per reference
SELECT reference,
  AVG(alignment_query_coverage(cigar, 'aligned')) AS avg_aligned_cov,
  AVG(alignment_query_coverage(cigar, 'mapped')) AS avg_mapped_cov
FROM read_alignments('alignments.bam')
WHERE NOT alignment_is_unmapped(flags)
GROUP BY reference;
```

**Use cases:**
- **Aligned coverage**: Assess quality of alignment (how much of read actually matches reference)
- **Mapped coverage**: Identify heavily clipped reads (adapters, chimeras, low-quality ends)
- Filter reads based on alignment quality thresholds
- QC metrics for sequencing runs

### `sequence_dna_reverse_complement(sequence)` and `sequence_rna_reverse_complement(sequence)`

Calculate the reverse complement of DNA or RNA sequences. Supports full IUPAC nucleotide ambiguity codes and preserves case.

**Parameters:**
- `sequence` (VARCHAR): DNA or RNA sequence string

**Returns:** VARCHAR - The reverse complement of the input sequence

**Behavior:**
- Reverses the sequence order (5' to 3' becomes 3' to 5')
- Complements each base according to Watson-Crick pairing rules
- Preserves uppercase/lowercase in the input
- Supports gap characters (`.` and `-`) which map to themselves
- Strict molecular type validation: DNA function rejects U bases, RNA function rejects T bases

**Supported bases:**
- **DNA**: A↔T, C↔G, plus IUPAC codes (R↔Y, S↔S, W↔W, K↔M, B↔V, D↔H, N↔N)
- **RNA**: A↔U, C↔G, plus IUPAC codes (R↔Y, S↔S, W↔W, K↔M, B↔V, D↔H, N↔N)

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Basic DNA reverse complement
SELECT sequence_dna_reverse_complement('ATCG');
-- Returns: CGAT

-- Basic RNA reverse complement
SELECT sequence_rna_reverse_complement('AUCG');
-- Returns: CGAU

-- Works with IUPAC ambiguity codes
SELECT sequence_dna_reverse_complement('ACGTMRWSYKVHDBN.-');
-- Returns: -.NVHDBMRSWYKACGT

-- Case is preserved
SELECT sequence_dna_reverse_complement('AcGt');
-- Returns: aCgT

-- Process sequences from FASTQ files
SELECT read_id,
       sequence1,
       sequence_dna_reverse_complement(sequence1) AS rev_comp
FROM read_fastx('sequences.fastq');

-- Find palindromic sequences (equal to their reverse complement)
SELECT read_id, sequence1
FROM read_fastx('sequences.fastq')
WHERE sequence1 = sequence_dna_reverse_complement(sequence1);

-- Error: DNA function rejects U bases
SELECT sequence_dna_reverse_complement('AUCG');
-- Error: Invalid DNA base 'U'

-- Error: RNA function rejects T bases
SELECT sequence_rna_reverse_complement('ATCG');
-- Error: Invalid RNA base 'T'
```

**IUPAC Ambiguity Code Reference:**
- R = A or G (purine)
- Y = C or T/U (pyrimidine)
- S = G or C (strong)
- W = A or T/U (weak)
- K = G or T/U (keto)
- M = A or C (amino)
- B = not A (C, G, T/U)
- D = not C (A, G, T/U)
- H = not G (A, C, T/U)
- V = not T/U (A, C, G)
- N = any base

### `compress_intervals(start, stop)`

Aggregate function that merges overlapping genomic intervals into a minimal set of non-overlapping intervals. Useful for computing coverage regions, reducing redundant intervals, and analyzing read depth.

**Parameters:**
- `start` (BIGINT): Start position of interval
- `stop` (BIGINT): Stop position of interval

**Returns:** `LIST<STRUCT(start BIGINT, stop BIGINT)>` - Array of merged intervals, sorted by start position

**Behavior:**
- Intervals that overlap or touch (stop₁ = start₂) are merged into a single interval
- Automatically compresses state when accumulating >1M intervals (prevents memory issues)
- Thread-safe: works correctly with parallel GROUP BY operations
- Returns NULL for empty groups

**Examples:**
```sql
-- Calculate coverage regions per reference from SAM/BAM alignments
SELECT reference,
       compress_intervals(position, stop_position) AS coverage
FROM read_alignments('alignments.bam')
GROUP BY reference;

-- Count number of distinct coverage regions per reference
SELECT reference,
       LEN(compress_intervals(position, stop_position)) AS num_regions
FROM read_alignments('alignments.bam')
GROUP BY reference;

-- Calculate total covered bases per reference
SELECT reference,
       SUM(c.stop - c.start) AS total_coverage
FROM (
  SELECT reference,
         UNNEST(compress_intervals(position, stop_position)) AS c
  FROM read_alignments('alignments.bam')
  GROUP BY reference
);

-- Find gaps in coverage (regions with no reads)
WITH coverage AS (
  SELECT reference,
         UNNEST(compress_intervals(position, stop_position)) AS interval
  FROM read_alignments('alignments.bam')
  GROUP BY reference
)
SELECT reference,
       interval.stop AS gap_start,
       LEAD(interval.start) OVER (PARTITION BY reference ORDER BY interval.start) AS gap_end
FROM coverage
WHERE LEAD(interval.start) OVER (PARTITION BY reference ORDER BY interval.start) IS NOT NULL;

-- Merge overlapping genomic features from different sources
CREATE TABLE features AS
  SELECT 'gene1' AS name, 'genome1' AS ref, 1000 AS start, 2000 AS stop
  UNION ALL SELECT 'gene2', 'genome1', 1500, 2500
  UNION ALL SELECT 'gene3', 'genome1', 3000, 4000;

SELECT ref,
       compress_intervals(start, stop) AS merged_regions
FROM features
GROUP BY ref;
```

**Performance Notes:**
- Automatic periodic compression at 1M intervals prevents memory bloat with large datasets
- Multi-threaded aggregation: each thread maintains its own state, merged at finalization
- Algorithm: sorts intervals by start position, then single-pass merge (O(n log n))

## COPY Formats

DuckDB miint provides custom COPY formats for writing bioinformatics file formats.

**Parameters:**
- `INCLUDE_HEADER` (default: true): Include header with reference sequences
  - **Note:** BAM format requires `INCLUDE_HEADER=true` (headers are mandatory in BAM files)
- `REFERENCE_LENGTHS` (VARCHAR, required if INCLUDE_HEADER=true): Table name containing reference sequences. Table must have at least 2 columns: first column = reference name (VARCHAR), second column = reference length (INTEGER/BIGINT). Column names don't matter.
- `COMPRESSION` (default: auto, SAM only): Enable gzip compression (auto-detected from `.gz` extension)
- `COMPRESSION_LEVEL` (BAM only): BGZF compression level 0-9 (default: 6). Higher = better compression, slower speed.

**SAM Format Examples:**
```sql
-- Create reference table (recommended for reuse, especially with large reference sets)
CREATE TABLE ref_table AS
  SELECT 'genome1' AS name, 248956422 AS length
  UNION ALL SELECT 'genome2', 242193529;

-- Basic SAM output with header
COPY (SELECT * FROM read_alignments('input.sam'))
TO 'output.sam' (FORMAT SAM, REFERENCE_LENGTHS 'ref_table');

-- Headerless SAM output (no reference lengths needed)
COPY (SELECT * FROM read_alignments('input.sam'))
TO 'output.sam' (FORMAT SAM, INCLUDE_HEADER false);

-- Compressed SAM output with header
COPY (SELECT * FROM read_alignments('input.sam'))
TO 'output.sam.gz' (FORMAT SAM, COMPRESSION gzip, REFERENCE_LENGTHS 'ref_table');

-- Filter and write high-quality alignments (headerless)
COPY (
  SELECT * FROM read_alignments('input.sam')
  WHERE mapq >= 30 AND NOT alignment_is_unmapped(flags)
) TO 'filtered.sam' (FORMAT SAM, INCLUDE_HEADER false);
```

**BAM Format Examples:**
```sql
-- Basic BAM output (always includes header)
COPY (SELECT * FROM read_alignments('input.sam'))
TO 'output.bam' (FORMAT BAM, REFERENCE_LENGTHS 'ref_table');

-- BAM with maximum compression
COPY (SELECT * FROM read_alignments('input.bam'))
TO 'compressed.bam' (FORMAT BAM, COMPRESSION_LEVEL 9, REFERENCE_LENGTHS 'ref_table');

-- BAM with no compression (fastest)
COPY (SELECT * FROM read_alignments('input.bam'))
TO 'uncompressed.bam' (FORMAT BAM, COMPRESSION_LEVEL 0, REFERENCE_LENGTHS 'ref_table');

-- Convert SAM to BAM
COPY (SELECT * FROM read_alignments('input.sam'))
TO 'output.bam' (FORMAT BAM, REFERENCE_LENGTHS 'ref_table');

-- Convert BAM to SAM
COPY (SELECT * FROM read_alignments('input.bam'))
TO 'output.sam' (FORMAT SAM, REFERENCE_LENGTHS 'ref_table');

-- Filter alignments and write to BAM
COPY (
  SELECT * FROM read_alignments('input.bam')
  WHERE mapq >= 30 AND alignment_is_primary(flags)
) TO 'filtered.bam' (FORMAT BAM, REFERENCE_LENGTHS 'ref_table');
```

**Notes:**
- SEQ and QUAL fields are always written as `*` in current implementation
- Reference lengths must be provided explicitly when writing headers - they cannot be inferred from the data
- All optional tags present in the input are preserved in the output
- BAM files always require headers (binary format specification)

## Running the tests
Different tests can be created for DuckDB extensions. The primary way of testing DuckDB extensions should be the SQL tests in `./test/sql`. These SQL tests can be run using:
```sh
make test
```

### Installing the deployed binaries
To install your extension binaries from S3, you will need to do two things. Firstly, DuckDB should be launched with the
`allow_unsigned_extensions` option set to true. How to set this will depend on the client you're using. Some examples:

CLI:
```shell
duckdb -unsigned
```

Python:
```python
con = duckdb.connect(':memory:', config={'allow_unsigned_extensions' : 'true'})
```

NodeJS:
```js
db = new duckdb.Database(':memory:', {"allow_unsigned_extensions": "true"});
```

Secondly, you will need to set the repository endpoint in DuckDB to the HTTP url of your bucket + version of the extension
you want to install. To do this run the following SQL query in DuckDB:
```sql
SET custom_extension_repository='bucket.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/<your_extension_name>/latest';
```
Note that the `/latest` path will allow you to install the latest extension version available for your current version of
DuckDB. To specify a specific version, you can pass the version instead.

After running these steps, you can install and load your extension using the regular INSTALL/LOAD commands in DuckDB:
```sql
INSTALL miint
LOAD miint
```
